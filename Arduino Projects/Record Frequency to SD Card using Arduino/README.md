# Aim
To detect the frequency and update in SD Card
<br>

# Purpose
Helpful to know the frequncy and it's further analysis
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad/ Offline
Arduino UNO
LCD 16 x 2 
Wires
Resistor 220 ohms 
Potentiometer 250 kilo-ohms
SD Card Module
<br>


# Workflow
We have completed the setup as per the given images mentioned in the '/images/'<br>
We use the SD card module as well as Function Generator to determine the frequency and update in SD Card. With the help of the function generator by applying various inputs variable frequncy could be obtained as well as updated to the '.txt' file.
<br>

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button then change the values for function generator to know the gist of the project. As well view the '.txt' file which is saved in respective directory.
