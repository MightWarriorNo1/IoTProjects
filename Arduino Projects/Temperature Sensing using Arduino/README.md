# Temperature sensing using Arduino
## AIM:
To get the temperature using arduino

## Purpose:
To update the temperature in degree celcius in every second.

## Component Required:
- Arduino UNO R3
- breadboard
- wires
- Temperature sensor [TMP36]
(Tinkercad can also be used.)

## Workflow:
- We initiate a loop
- A delay of 1s is added.

## Setup instructions:
- Assemble the circuit as shown below.

- Temperature has three terminals - Vs, Vout and GND. We will connect the sensor as follows âˆ’
  - Connect the +Vs to +5v on your Arduino board.
  - Connect Vout to Analog0 or A0 on Arduino board.
  - Connect GND with GND on Arduino.
- Upload the code provided [here](https://github.com/ritikalohia/IoT-Spot/blob/main/Arduino/Temperature%20Sensing/temperature.ino)
- Run to see the project in action!
