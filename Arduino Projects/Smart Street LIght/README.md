# Aim
Smart Street Light using arduino
<br>

# Purpose
to save electricity through smart use of street light
<br>

# Component required
Simulation environment - Tinkercad

arduino uno 

LDR

3 IR sensors

Wires

bulbs

power supply
<br>


# Workflow
Street light gets automatically on when the light intensity is less , if the intensity is more then it will be in off condition.

Street lights will be in ON condition only when the intensity of sunlight is less and vehicle or person is using the road.
We use IR sensors to detect if the road is busy and we use LDR to detect the intensity of sunlight.

From this project we can save electricity by not keeping street lights in ON condition at night and the ON/OFF of the street light is made automatic so there will be no human interference which means no human error to on/off the street light.

# Setup 
Connect the circuit diagram as shown in the image and press the simulation button.
to on/off the ir sensor we use ir remote, but if you are doing it using hardware arduino then use the comments in the program.
